Pyscript is a growing python frontend language. It can be used to write python functions in pure html.

I had created a simple to do app that communicates with a RESTFUL API using pyscript and html.


To install:

git clone "repo_url"

Install all requirements:

pip install requirements.txt

To run:

start a python development server for your html or simple used the go live plugin on vscode.

python -m http server (to serve it manually)
